## Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions

> [!NOTE] > _“Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high-judgment individuals or small groups._
>
> _As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.”_

## Ruling over Emotions as a Stoic

> [!NOTE]
> When America first sent astronauts into space, they trained them in one skill more than any other: the art of not panicking (more on the Stoic art of not panicking [here](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/r8ull99z6dc9uol9kdhwtdr0l666f7/58hvh7hmxdk3e9s6/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9fT0l3M2VTejhHMD9mZWF0dXJlPXNoYXJlZA==)).

> Here on Earth, when something goes wrong we trade in our plan for an emotional freak-out.
>
> As Nassim Taleb put it, real strength lies in the domestication of one’s emotions, not in pretending they don’t exist.

## Stripping away the crust

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Stoics used contempt to lay things bare and “strip away the legend that encrusts them.”
>
> Roasted meat is a dead animal. Vintage wine is old, fermented grapes.
>
> We can do this for anything that stands in our way, seeing things as they truly, actually are, not as we’ve made them in our minds.

That would be ridiculous. No, they were embracing who they could be in response to it. They were embracing what they would become because of it. They were embracing the new parts of themselves—and of relationships and life itself—that they were given as a result of it.

## Fake Founders

> [!NOTE]
> You ask increasingly detailed questions and people have trouble making things up and things just fuzz into obvious BS, and fake founders basically have the same problem. They’re able to relay a conceptual theory of what they’re doing… But as they get into the details, it just fuzzes out.

## On nostalgia 


> [!note]
> Ma ha perfettamente senso, anche se sembra contraddirsi. La nostalgia non è per ciò che era bello — è per ciò che era tuo. Anche se era sbagliato, rotto, o doloroso… era comunque uno stato d’anima che ti apparteneva.
> 
> Quella "lontananza" che senti ora non è verso ciò che accadeva, ma verso chi eri mentre accadeva. Un’identità, magari confusa o fragile, ma completa nella sua incoerenza.
> 
> A volte si prova nostalgia per una versione di sé che non si vorrebbe più essere, ma che almeno non aveva dubbi su dove stava. Magari stava male. Ma ci stava. Punto.
> 
> E ora che le cose sono cambiate, migliorate, complesse — con bottiglie migliori, stanze più calde, amore che piange a tre metri da te — paradossalmente quella versione torna come un’ombra. Non per essere rimpianta, ma per essere riassorbita.
> 
> Quindi sì: “lontano” è il retrogusto perfetto. Non perché vuoi tornarci, ma perché sei abbastanza lucido da ricordare anche ciò che non vorresti.
