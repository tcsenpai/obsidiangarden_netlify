Advancing the king's pawn two squares is highly useful because it occupies a [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess "Glossary of chess") square, attacks the center square d5, and allows the [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess "Glossary of chess") of White's [king's bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess's_bishop "Glossary of chess") and [queen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)> "Queen (chess)"). Chess [grandmaster](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)> "Grandmaster (chess)") [Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer "Bobby Fischer") said that the King's Pawn Game is "Best by test",[[2\|2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Pawn_Game#cite_note-2) and proclaimed that "With 1.e4! I win."[[3\|3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Pawn_Game)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")\_]

## Queen's Gambit

The **Queen's Gambit** starts after the moves **1.d4 d5 2.c4**. White's second move attacks the d5-pawn, increasing control over the center. If Black decides to take the pawn with 2...dxc4, White will have successfully deflected one of Black's central pawns to the board's wing.

##### Queen's Gambit Declined

Black's second most played option is the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black doesn't take the white pawn on c4 and instead reinforces their center with 2...e6. Another solid option for Black, this choice has the downside of placing a pawn on the light-squared bishop's way.

Black's plan usually involves counterattacking White's d4-pawn with the c7-c5 push. In most cases, one of the players accepts creating structural weaknesses for dynamic compensation, such as taking the initiative or brewing a powerful attack.

# Defenses

## Queen's Pawn Opening: Mikėnas Defense

[[IMG-20241106232526644.jpeg|Open: board(3).png]]
![IMG-20241106232526644.jpeg](/img/user/_resources/IMG-20241106232526644.jpeg)
The Mikėnas Defense is a lesser-known chess opening that offers some unique possibilities and transpositions to other well-established defenses. While its soundness is debated, it can be a useful tool for players looking to mix up their repertoire and challenge their opponents. The Mikėnas Defense begins responding to White's advance of the queen's pawn by immediately challenging control over the center.

## Kings's pawn opening: Scandinavian Defense

![IMG-20241106232526698.jpeg](/img/user/_resources/IMG-20241106232526698.jpeg)

The **Scandinavian Defense** is one of Black's more offbeat responses to White's 1.e4, where Black immediately attacks the white pawn with 1...d5. This is how it got its old name of the Center Counter, because Black immediately counters in the center.

Easily White's best response, and overwhelmingly its most popular, is to capture with 2.exd5. Although it is Black's first move that defines the Scandinavian, the position after that pawn capture is effectively the starting position for the opening. It's at this point where the Scandinavian really gets interesting.

## Nimzowitsch Defense

![IMG-20241106232526760.jpeg](/img/user/_resources/IMG-20241106232526760.jpeg)

This opening is an example of a [hypermodern](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermodernism_(chess)> "Hypermodernism (chess)") opening in which Black invites White to occupy the [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess "Glossary of chess") of the board at an early stage with pawns.[[1\|1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzowitsch_Defence) Black's intent is to block or otherwise restrain White's central pawns and, if allowed to do so by inaccurate play by White, eventually undermine the White pawn centre by well-timed pawn advances of their own or by attacking the white pieces defending the centre. The Nimzowitsch Defense (1.e4 Nc6) is a classical hypermodern defense that aims to challenge White's central pawns rather than immediately attacking them.
