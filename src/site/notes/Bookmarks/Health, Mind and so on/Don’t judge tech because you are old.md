Here's a quote to keep in mind every time a new tech makes you go *"No that's dumb and wrong"*

> 1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> 2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

Douglas Adams. One of his best insights, if you ask me. As I slowly turn into an old fart (37 last week), this quote helps me judge new developments on their merits.

When you say a new piece of tech couldn't possibly be useful because it isn't good enough, it's too different, doesn't solve all edge cases, or whatever ... remember to look inside you and ask *"Am I just being old and dismissing this because it's different than what I'm used to?"*.

you may be surprised

Cheers,

PS: if you look deeply, you'll be surprised how many of your favorite ways of doing things are just an expression of tech limitations at the time. As those limitations go away, the best approach changes
