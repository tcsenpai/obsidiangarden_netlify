Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute, but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective.

We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, what we value and dismiss.

Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference. Consider two people standing in the same room: They experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same.

==However, relativity is not the same as relativism—­ the idea that all perspectives are equally valid. Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Rather, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference.==

We all have blind spots—­ things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly
