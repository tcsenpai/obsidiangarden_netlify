# Any place in 3 Words (Cohordinates)

[https://what3words.com](https://what3words.com)

Three words encode the same information as latitude and longitude—`38.89`​, `-77.03`​—chunking the information to be small enough to fit in our working memory.

The mapping of locations to words uses a list of 40 thousand common English words, so each word encodes 15.29 bits of information—45.9 bits of information, identifying 64 trillion unique places.
