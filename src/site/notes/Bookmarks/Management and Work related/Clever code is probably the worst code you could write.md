Engineer‚Äôs Codex

_Engineer‚Äôs Codex is a free publication about real-world software engineering. I write about real-world [technical case studies](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-instagram-scaled-to-14-million), [outages](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-one-line-of-code-caused-a-60), and [interesting stories](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-to-burnout-a-software-engineer) from the industry._

When I was an undergrad, Leetcode broke my brain. I would see top solutions of esoteric one-liners and wrongly think ‚Äúhow do I ever get this good?‚Äù

This is commonly called ‚Äúcode golfing‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fun hobby, but very far from ‚Äúgood code.‚Äù

Everybody (including those on Leetcode) knows this isn‚Äôt good code. In the industry, it‚Äôs the worst code one could write.

Okay, I admit - this is a _pretty bad example of clever code_, _because it is so obviously bad. Here‚Äôs an example of a code snippet I came across in some old code that I found annoying:_

However, on the other end of the spectrum, I realized eventually that the **clearest code was actually the hardest to write.**

It made sense retrospectively. Reviewing the code of a senior staff software engineer was much easier to follow and review compared to the code of an entry-level L3 engineer.

To be a top software engineer, you need to know a lot. But how do you know what you don't know? **[SWE Quiz](https://swequiz.com/?utm_source=codex) is a compilation of 450+ software engineering and system design questions covering databases, authentication, caching, etc.**

**They‚Äôve been created by engineers from Google, Meta, Apple, and more.**

It‚Äôs helped many of my peers (including myself) pass the ‚Äúsoftware trivia questions‚Äù during interviews and feel more confident at work.

_For a brief period of time, SWE Quiz is available for lifetime access._

The ‚Äúpower‚Äù of clear code, for better or for worse, was made fully clear to me after a certain incident at work.

I once wrote a module in C++, a language that is a bit harder to read compared to other languages simply due to its verbosity.

I started with just two files (.h/.cpp) and all the implementation code went into just these two files.

The result was this giant, disgusting piece of spaghetti on the inside, but a perfectly working program on the outside.

This would _never_ get past code review.

I split the implementation into 8-10 diffs. Each diff was a neat, containerized piece of code, with convenient placeholders for dependencies that would arrive in a later diff. It had code neatly split out into helper functions and helper files when necessary.

Each diff had reasonable unit test coverage - the basics and some obvious edge cases were covered, but I didn‚Äôt go wastefully overboard with it.

Each diff also took me quite a few iterations of ‚Äúcode cleaning,‚Äù refactoring, and more. **It took a lot more effort than I expected to achieve ‚Äúclear code,‚Äù especially for such a large program.**

The result? _A beautiful landing of the module, with easy to read, clear code._

While I was proud of it, there was suddenly a **problem** when I talked to my manager about it.

> ‚ÄúWhile I understand how complex this was, when it comes to performance reviews, this code looks trivial. It looks too easy, too simple.
>
> I would recommend writing an implementation doc of this module just so we can demonstrate that this was actually quite complex.‚Äù

I was shocked - this wasn‚Äôt some startup. This was one of the biggest companies in the world, _known for their engineering culture_.

I now understood why Big Tech seemingly had so many docs ‚Äî half of the docs I wrote didn‚Äôt _need_ to be written, except they did‚Ä¶ because I wanted to get raises and be promoted.

While promotion culture in Big Tech is a story for another article (subscribe to see it in your inbox soon üôÇ), the main point here is that **great code is very clear and readable.**

There‚Äôs a [popular saying](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws) that **debugging code is twice as hard as writing it**. It‚Äôs the reason why when ChatGPT outputs some hogwash, it‚Äôs easier just to re-prompt it or write it from scratch yourself instead of trying to figure out the errors in its buggy code.

- The only way I got better at writing clear, readable code was just **writing a lot of code while strictly following a clear style guide.**
  - Also, having more experienced devs review my code with a magnifying glass.
    - It was agony to get tons of comments and ‚Äúnits‚Äù about seemingly pointless style in the beginning, but it paid off in the end.
- Coding style is **more important** than I expected in the beginning. My start to software engineering started from being on the product-minded end of the spectrum and moved towards the ‚Äútechnical-minded‚Äù side of the spectrum.¬†
  - I had started coding solely to start a business, so I initially only cared about code as a tool, resulting in crappy, unmaintainable code.
  - It‚Äôs only through more experience with writing code and working within teams that the importance of clear, readable code became more obvious.
  - It‚Äôs not just me. This is an obvious revelation to anybody who has been writing code in the industry for more than a year.
- **[John Carmack once wrote a long email about coding style in 2007, which is an interesting read.](http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html)**
- [Google probably has the most public style guide](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-google-writes-clean-maintainable). Vercel also recently released their [style guide](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide?utm_source=tldrwebdev), and pretty much every company uses some sort of linter and prettifier.
