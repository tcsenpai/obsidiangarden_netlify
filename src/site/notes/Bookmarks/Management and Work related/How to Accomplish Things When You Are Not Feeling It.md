### Know That at Some Point You Will Be Motivated

When organizing your week, recognize that while this Monday moment may be uninspiring, at some point there will be inspiration. Lay out your week to reflect that. Have faith!

### Do the Easiest Thing on Your List

I find the least demanding thing on my task list to accomplish first. Checking one thing off can either get me rolling toward bigger things or onto the next small task I can muster. Either way, crossing off anything puts me in a better headspace.

### Break Down a Big Task into Smaller Pieces

If you don’t have any small tasks, take some time to list out all the steps needed for a big project. For example, you might have “first draft of dashboard design due” on your calendar. AHHHHH! I’m too tired to start a draft. Ask yourself what little pieces make up the dashboard layout. Can you start by collecting color palettes? Maybe you can review the data that needs to be displayed. You could search for “cool dashboard design” to find inspiration.

### Don’t Try to Finish a Project—Just Start It

If I’m intimidated by a blank layout, I make the decision to get anything onto the page. I’ll just copy and paste the content. Small step—check. Then I’ll start formatting the text to get the hierarchy going. My mindset isn’t “get this done”; it’s “I’ll figure it out later,” and I always do. Opening the file the next day is 1,000 times better than starting from zero.

### Do a Household Task

If all else fails, fold laundry. There is always laundry. Sometimes it’s the type of work that is a blocker for me. Doing another activity that is productive will get my mind moving enough that when I sit back down at my desk, I can find something I can do.

Productivity doesn’t always come easily, especially on those cold, uninspiring days. But by organizing your week, starting small, breaking tasks into manageable pieces, and giving yourself permission to just begin, you can turn the hardest moments into opportunities for progress. Remember, it’s not about doing it all at once—it’s about taking the first step. With these tips, you’ll be ready to tackle even the most daunting to-do list, one small win at a time. You’ve got this!
