I’ve seen brilliant engineering teams spend months building features no one uses and solving problems that didn’t exist. This was not because they lacked skill or effort but because they never truly understood the real problem. How much time could we save if we just asked the right questions first?

Imagine this: A customer success manager sends an urgent request to the product team: “We need a feature to export invoices to CSV.” The team starts planning, but a curious product manager asks, “Why do they need this?” After digging deeper, they realize customers don’t just want a CSV file. They actually need better ways to track payments. Instead of rushing to build the wrong feature, the actual solution is improving in-app analytics.

Sound familiar? Welcome to the **XY Problem.**

The XY Problem is a common communication issue that occurs when someone asking for help focuses on their **attempted solution (X)** rather than **the root problem itself (Y)**. This misstep often leads to confusion, wasted time, and solutions that fail to address the underlying issue.

In our example, the team almost built a CSV export feature based on the initial request. But by asking a few more questions, they uncovered the true need: stronger analytics tools. When we don't understand the problem, we risk building something that doesn’t truly help our customers or advance our product.

Here are a few examples of the XY Problem in action from software engineering:

- A developer insists on adding a new caching system to improve speed (**X**). However, after further discussion, the team finds that the actual issue (**Y**) is an inefficient database query.
- A teammate asks, “How can I grab the last three characters in a filename?” (**X**). Deeper probing reveals the real need (**Y**): properly extracting the file extension, which may not always be three characters long.
- A stakeholder asks for a button to refresh a dashboard (**X**), but what users truly need is auto-refresh (**Y**) so they receive up-to-date information without having to click a button.

Imagine someone running as fast as they can, trying to reach a destination quickly. Frustrated by the long, winding path, they ask, **“How can I run faster?”** A well-meaning friend suggests, **“Try better running shoes!”** They lace up the best shoes and speed up—but they’re still on the wrong path.

Now, imagine they stop for a moment and ask, **“What’s the fastest way to get there?”** The friend points out a shortcut—a direct route that avoids all the detours. Suddenly, the answer isn’t about running faster; it’s about running the right way.

This small change in thinking makes a big difference. Just like a runner speeding along the wrong path, a team can work fast and hard but still waste time if not headed in the right direction. Speed matters, but only when movement follows the right path.

Note this analogy does not imply delaying action or overthinking every decision. This shows rapid execution works best after first understanding the true problem. Taking a moment to ask “why” can save effort and turn speed into a real advantage.

For engineering leaders, focusing on the right problem is essential. Solving the wrong problem can lead to several issues:

- **Wasted Time and Effort:** When a team builds a feature that doesn’t address the actual issue, valuable time and energy are lost. This delay not only holds back the real fix but also diverts resources from solutions that could make a significant impact.
- **Missed Opportunities:** By focusing on symptoms instead of the root cause, breakthrough improvements can be overlooked. Addressing the core problem can lead to innovations that boost user satisfaction and set the product apart.
- **Team Frustration:** Working on the wrong problem can leave teams disheartened and burnt out. When efforts fail to bring visible, positive change, morale suffers, making it harder for teams to stay engaged and productive.

Engineering leaders who guide their teams to focus on the right problems drive real progress, maintain high team motivation, and pave the way for lasting success.

Understand the ‘Why’ before committing to the ‘How.’

Before diving into a solution, take the time to understand the problem fully. Here are some simple steps:

1.  **Ask “Why”:** Start by asking why the problem exists. What is really causing the issue? This often reveals a deeper problem.
2.  **Question Assumptions:** Don’t jump to the first solution that comes to mind. Ask, “Is this really the problem, or just a sign of something bigger?”
3.  **Talk It Out:** Encourage your team to ask questions and share their thoughts. A team that talks openly can often find the best solution together.
4.  **Break Down the Problem:** Use simple techniques like repeatedly asking “Why?” (as in the _Five Whys_ method) to uncover the root cause of the problem.
5.  **Check the Facts:** Use data and customer feedback to confirm your understanding of the problem. Facts can help clear up any confusion.

There’s a subtle art to answering questions with respect and offering help, all while digging deeper to uncover the actual goal behind a request. When you pose thoughtful questions and share more context, you empower others to give clearer, more useful responses.

In engineering, this practice saves time and effort; in customer support, it creates happier customers; and in product design, it can reveal needs that were previously overlooked.

As a leader, rapid action is key—but it’s equally important to ensure that you lead your team in the right direction. Rushing into a solution without understanding the actual issue can waste time, miss chances for true innovation, and drain energy.

Take a moment to ask the right questions. Picture someone hurrying who pauses to find the optimal route instead of just speeding along. This slight pause doesn’t slow things down; it makes your actions more effective and impactful.

When an urgent request or an obvious solution arises, remember: stop solving the wrong problem. Dig deeper, ask “why,” and steer your team toward what really matters. This approach not only saves time and resources but also builds a motivated, forward-thinking team ready to take on challenges with speed and purpose.

Stay curious, keep questioning, and lead with clarity.
