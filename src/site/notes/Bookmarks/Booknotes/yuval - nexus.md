## Naive vision of the information

Despite the extremely large amount of information, humanity has not necessarily progressed towards informed ethics or smart powerful people decisions.

AI can make decisions on behalf of humans thanks to the enormous amount of information available to it.

The DYOR paradigm that fuels some conspiracy theories and theorists would collapse when large scale collaborations are needed.
