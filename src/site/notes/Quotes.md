## The Hard part

> [!NOTE]
>
> The hard part isn't knowing what to do; it's doing it daily, whether you feel like it or not.
>
> The challenge isn't knowing you should work out; it's putting on your shoes and running in the cold when you'd rather sit at home under a warm blanket. The challenge isn't determining the most important project; it's sitting down and doing it when you'd rather browse social media.
>
> If you're waiting for inspiration, you've already lost.

## Slow is Fast

> [!NOTE] > _"It's true that becoming an empathic listener takes time, but it doesn't take any-where near as much time as it takes to back up and correct misunderstandings when you're already miles down the road, to redo, and to live with unexpressed and unsolved problems."_

_Stephen Covey_

## Mental Junk

> [!NOTE]
>

>
> For a healthy body, choose whole foods. For a sharp mind, choose lasting knowledge.
>

## Step by step

> [!NOTE]
> Champions obsess over fundamentals, not trophies.
> While others chase revenue and fancy titles, outliers focus on what they can control today: reading one more book, making one more phone call, and reviewing that email one final time. They know that excellence comes from perfecting the basics.
> Stop worrying about where the arrow lands. Master the art of drawing the bow.

## Don’t fight

> [!NOTE]
> All the energy you put into arguing with reality comes at the expense of improving your situation. The mountain doesn't care how much you yell at it, but you'll find a path around it if you stop and look.

## Smart Error Handling

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to admit your mistakes, and to do so before you are charged with them. Many clients are surrounded by buck-passers who make a fine art of blaming the agency for their own failures. I seize the earliest opportunity to assume the blame

> [! NOTE]
> "It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. They outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life."
